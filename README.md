# UCSD-MLE-Bootcamp-Capstone-Project Data Collection Unit 3.5.2 Capstone Submission
## Submitted by David Schonberger, 21 December, 2021
## See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MsBeSa2sujr_A1eT3QPI7kjxqXY9FjGO2xeVg_gJLJY/edit for my original ideas on possible Capstone projects.

### The /Data-collection folder contains three subfolders, each with some sample data collected and Jupyter notebooks that provide additional documentation, links, and relevant code to access data.

### The /Neuroscience-data folder contains data for Idea 1: Applications of Graph Theory and ML in Neuroscience, in the Google doc

### The /Artifical-genome-data folder contain data for Idea 3: Apply ML/DL to Genomics: Generating artificial human genomes via Deep Neural Networks (GANs), in the Google doc

### The /Radiogenomics-data folder contains data for Idea 5: Apply ML/DL to Radiogenomics, in the Google doc. Note that as of now, this is the idea I intend to use for my Capstone project.
