## Data Collection Unit 3.5.2 Capstone Submission, 21 December, 2021

## See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MsBeSa2sujr_A1eT3QPI7kjxqXY9FjGO2xeVg_gJLJY/edit for my original ideas on possible Capstone projects.

### The /Data-collection folder contains three subfolders, each with some sample data collected and Jupyter notebooks that provide additional documentation, links, and relevant code to access data.

### The /Neuroscience-data folder contains data for Idea 1: Applications of Graph Theory and ML in Neuroscience, in the Google doc

### The /Artifical-genome-data folder contain data for Idea 3: Apply ML/DL to Genomics: Generating artificial human genomes via Deep Neural Networks (GANs), in the Google doc

### The /Radiogenomics-data folder contains data for Idea 5: Apply ML/DL to Radiogenomics, in the Google doc. Note that as of now, this is the idea I intend to use for my Capstone project.

## Unit 8.6 Step 3: Benchmarking a model and Step 4: Project Proposal

## I elected to go with Idea 5 (see above).

## The project proposal may be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyqM9RP_wHTwNm5PT9XNBPpVxTi7ws35hezHXTww88s/edit?usp=sharing

## The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/overview
